Real Estate Rental Web Application

As a Front-End Developer, I designed and implemented the user interface for a web application that enables property rental and leasing. My work focused on creating a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly experience while integrating seamlessly with the backend services provided by Django.

I developed dynamic pages for property browsing, booking, and user account management. This included interactive forms, a real-time property search and filtering system, and a visually engaging booking calendar. I ensured that the application works smoothly across devices and screen sizes.
